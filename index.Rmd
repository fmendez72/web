# **Welcome**

I am a researcher based at the Univesity of ZÃ¼rich. A political scientist by training, my work is mostly interdisciplinary blending various sub-fields of Political Science (e.g., comparative politics, political behaviour and political communication) while also drawing on other fields such as Comparative Law and Computer Science. 

#### Some of my ongoing research activities:
*   *Comparative politics* (especially cross-national comparative work on institutions of direct democracy)  
*   *Political behaviour* (especially political attitudes and voting behaviour)
*   *Political communication* (especially around the analysis of Big Data using topic modeling and sentiment analysis techniques)  
<<<<<<< HEAD
*   *Digital Politics and Policy * (especially internet voting and e-participation)
