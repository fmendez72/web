# **Welcome**

I'm a researcher based at the Univesity of ZÃ¼rich. A political scientist by training, my work is mostly interdisciplinary blending various sub-fields of Political Science (e.g., comparative politics, political behaviour and political communication) while also drawing on other fields such as Comparative Law and Computer Science. 

#### Some of my ongoing research activities:
*   *Comparative politics* (esp. cross-national comparative work on institutions of direct democracy)  
*   *Political behaviour* (esp. political attitudes and voting behaviour)
*   *Applied political communication* (mainly around the design of interactive online opinion surveys; annotation platforms)  
*   *e-Democracy* (esp. internet voting)  
*   *Computational text analysis* (mainly topic modeling and sentiment analysis)  
*   *Machine learning* (mainly supervised learning approaches to voting behaviour)
