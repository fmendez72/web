# Direct Democracy
Much of my research has focused on direct democraqcy and other forms of political participation. A lot of this work was done while I was at the [c2d](http://c2d.ch), the leading centre for the study of direct democracy. Below is a sample of recent work and ongoing research: <br/>

<br/>

##### Ongoing research
I am involved in an interdisciplinary European Research Council project, [LIDD](https://www.ivr.uzh.ch/en/institutsmitglieder/moeckli/Research-project-LIDD.html), which focuses on the limits of direct democracy. Within the project I am currently exploring two main areas

1. *Mapping institutions of direct democracy across the 48 member states of the Council of Europe*. This project is presently focused on developing a new database of institutions and practices in the CoE states [[see more]](https://www.ivr.uzh.ch/en/institutsmitglieder/moeckli/Research-project-LIDD.html).

2. *The Agenda inititive in Europe and America: A cross-regional perspective* This project focuses on large country comparison of one of the least well understood instruments of direct democracy that is nonethless surprisingly popular in Europe and America.

# Political behaviour
This research area includes various themes related to the study of political attitudes, party politics and especially voting behaviour. A lot of the research draws on data generated from voting advice applications.

##### Ongoing research
I am working with Micha Germann and Kostas Gemenis on a project that focuses on re-evaluating spatial voting models in a Big Data context. A second, separate paper focuses on the role of political information provision and party support.

<br/>

# Political communication
I have an interest in applied political communication research, most of which is focused on the design and impact of voting advice applications.
