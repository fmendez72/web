# Direct Democracy
Much of my research has focused on direct democraqcy and other forms of political participation. A lot of this work was done while I was at the [c2d](http://c2d.ch), the leading centre for the study of direct democracy. Below is a sample of recent work and ongoing research: <br/>

<br/>

##### Ongoing research
I am involved in an interdisciplinary European Research Council project, [LIDD](https://www.ivr.uzh.ch/en/institutsmitglieder/moeckli/Research-project-LIDD.html), which focuses on the limits of direct democracy. Within the project I am currently exploring two main areas

1. *Mapping institutions of direct democracy across the 48 member states of the Council of Europe*. This project is presently focused on developing a new database of institutions and practices in the CoE states [[see more]](https://www.ivr.uzh.ch/en/institutsmitglieder/moeckli/Research-project-LIDD.html).

2. *The Agenda inititive in Europe and America: A cross-regional perspective* This project focuses on large country comparison of one of the least well understood instruments of direct democracy that is nonethless surprisingly popular in Europe and America.

# Political behaviour
This research area includes various themes related to the study of political attitudes, party politics and especially voting behaviour. A lot of the research draws on data generated from voting advice applications.

##### Ongoing research
I am working with Micha Germann and Kostas Gemenis on a project that focuses on re-evaluating spatial voting models in a Big Data context. A second, separate paper focuses on the role of political information provision and party support.

# Political communication
I have a strong interest in applied political communication research. Much of this work is focused on the design and impact of voting advice applications as well as developing coding and annotation platforms. Recently, I have started to use computational text analysis techniques (such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis) to evaluate, for instance news coverage during elections and the communication of EU public policies.

# Machine learning
I am very interested in mostly supervised machine learning approaches to data analysis. In particular, I have been very keen to apply these methods to the analysis of party preferences while drawing on large N datasets of public opinion. Also, of interest is the use of such techniques for methodological aspects such as data cleaning. 

[(2017) Modeling proximity and directional decisional logic: What can we learn from applying statistical learning techniques to VAA-generated data? *Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties*](https://doi.org/10.1080/17457289.2016.1269113)
